# cBTC Protocol – Overview

cBTC is an experimental, Bitcoin-native protocol that explores how Bitcoin
can be used as **working capital** without introducing fiat pegs, price oracles,
liquidations, or custodial risk.

The protocol is designed around conservative, deterministic rules and uses
Bitcoin itself as the ultimate enforcement layer.

---

## Motivation

Bitcoin is an excellent store of value, but using it as productive capital
often requires giving up custody, accepting liquidation risk, or relying on
fiat-referenced systems.

cBTC explores an alternative approach:

- keep everything denominated in BTC,
- avoid price-based liquidations,
- rely on time-based commitments instead of volatility,
- preserve self-custody through Bitcoin-native mechanisms.

## High-level concept

At a high level, cBTC works as follows:

1. A Bitcoin holder deposits BTC to open a **Minting Channel**.
2. The deposited BTC is split on-chain into three parts:
   - **Principal (70%)** – remains under the control of the depositor and is
     intended to be time-locked.
   - **Redemption Pool (15%)** – global reserve used exclusively to redeem cBTC
     back into BTC.
   - **Yield Allocation (15%)** – prefunded yield that vests over time.
3. A fixed amount of cBTC is issued at channel creation.
4. cBTC circulates as a bearer asset and can be transferred off-chain.
5. cBTC can be redeemed for BTC from the Redemption Pool according to
   deterministic rules.

## Minting Channels

A **Minting Channel** is a time-bound capital commitment.

Key properties:

- Issuance happens only at channel opening.
- Loan-to-value (LTV) is fixed at creation.
- No refinancing or rollover is possible.
- Early closure is allowed but penalized.

Minted cBTC amount:

- `Minted cBTC = 30,000 × deposited BTC`

This corresponds to a 30% issuance ratio, with a redemption floor of:

- `1 cBTC = 0.00001 BTC`

---

## Yield and time commitment

Yield in cBTC is:

- prefunded at channel creation,
- non-linear and time-based,
- not generated by lending or rehypothecation.

If a Minting Channel is closed before the minimum duration:

- unvested yield is forfeited,
- forfeited yield is transferred to the Redemption Pool,
- principal is never touched.

This mechanism aligns incentives toward longer commitments without forcing
liquidations.

---

## Redemption

cBTC is redeemable exclusively for BTC.

Redemption rules:

- Redemptions are paid **only** from the global Redemption Pool.
- cBTC is burned upon redemption.
- Principal and yield collateral are never used for redemption.

Redemption rates depend on the solvency of the Redemption Pool and follow
transparent, deterministic tiers.

---

## Solvency and risk model

The protocol enforces solvency through simple global rules:

- The Redemption Pool must cover a minimum fraction of total redemption liability.
- New minting halts automatically if solvency thresholds are breached.
- There are no emergency interventions or discretionary liquidations.

Risk is managed through:
- conservative issuance,
- prefunded reserves,
- time-based incentives,
- and explicit limits.

---

## Current scope

At this stage, the protocol is demonstrated using:

- Bitcoin Core regtest,
- manual and scripted coordination,
- off-chain accounting for cBTC balances.

Lightning, Taproot Assets, and full decentralization are **future research areas**
and are not part of the current MVP.

---

## Purpose of this repository

This repository exists to:

- document the protocol design,
- demonstrate core invariants on regtest,
- invite critical review and experimentation,
- evolve the implementation incrementally.

The goal is not speed, but correctness and clarity.
